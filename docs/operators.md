# Probescript Operators
These are the operators probescript supports now, as well as a brief explanation.

## Binary Operators
These operators are used to perform operations between two values:

    + (Addition Operator): Adds two operands.

        Example: 5 + 3 results in 8.

    - (Subtraction Operator): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.

        Example: 5 - 3 results in 2.

    * (Multiplication Operator): Multiplies two operands.

        Example: 5 * 3 results in 15.

    / (Division Operator): Divides the left operand by the right operand.

        Example: 6 / 3 results in 2.

    % (Modulo Operator): Returns the remainder of division of two operands.

        Example: 5 % 3 results in 2.

    < (Less Than Operator): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.

        Example: 5 < 10 results in true.

    > (Greater Than Operator): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

        Example: 5 > 3 results in true.

    <= (Less Than or Equal To Operator): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

        Example: 5 <= 5 results in true.

    >= (Greater Than or Equal To Operator): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

        Example: 5 >= 3 results in true.

    == (Equality Operator): Checks if two operands are equal.

        Example: 5 == 5 results in true.

    != (Inequality Operator): Checks if two operands are not equal.

        Example: 5 != 3 results in true.

## Assignment Operator

This operator is used to assign values to variables:

    = (Assignment Operator): Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.

        Example: x = 10 assigns the value 10 to x.

## Logical Operators

These operators are used to perform logical operations:

    && (Logical AND Operator): Returns true if both operands are true.

        Example: true && false results in false.

    || (Logical OR Operator): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.

        Example: true || false results in true.

## Increment/Decrement Operators

These operators are used to increase or decrease a value:

    ++ (Increment Operator): Increases the value of the operand by 1.

        Example: x++ increases x by 1.

    -- (Decrement Operator): Decreases the value of the operand by 1.

        Example: x-- decreases x by 1.

## Assignment Operators

These operators are used to perform operations and then assign the result to a variable:

    += (Addition Assignment Operator): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

        Example: x += 5 is equivalent to x = x + 5.

    -= (Subtraction Assignment Operator): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

        Example: x -= 5 is equivalent to x = x - 5.

    *= (Multiplication Assignment Operator): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

        Example: x *= 5 is equivalent to x = x * 5.

    /= (Division Assignment Operator): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

        Example: x /= 5 is equivalent to x = x / 5.

## Comparison Operators

These operators are used to compare two values:

    == (Equality Operator): Checks if two operands are equal.

        Example: 5 == 5 results in true.

    != (Inequality Operator): Checks if two operands are not equal.

        Example: 5 != 3 results in true.

    < (Less Than Operator): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.

        Example: 5 < 10 results in true.

    > (Greater Than Operator): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

        Example: 5 > 3 results in true.

    <= (Less Than or Equal To Operator): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

        Example: 5 <= 5 results in true.

    >= (Greater Than or Equal To Operator): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

        Example: 5 >= 3 results in true.
